Okay I have the simple flask routing system working in python.
Now I just have to set up a simple Portfolio page with links and the homepage.

I think I'm going to use this:
https://www.muicss.com/

1: Set up the main page as a resume.
2: setup up the portfolio page then a demo of something done in python.

I've added a basic resume. I'll have to make it look a lot better later on.
I want to keep the resume very brief.

same day: 9:06
I want to look into this css framework when I have time.

For now it seems I've finished my portfolio and homepage.
I really do need more information on that resume or portfolio for it to be effective.
But I think from now on I'll be updating more of my portfolio.
