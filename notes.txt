Okay I have the simple flask routing system working in python.
Now I just have to set up a simple Portfolio page with links and the homepage.

I think I'm going to use this:
https://www.muicss.com/

1: Set up the main page as a resume.
2: setup up the portfolio page then a demo of something done in python.
